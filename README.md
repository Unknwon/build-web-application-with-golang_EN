***Build Web Application with Golang***
=======================================
###***Translator Comments***
This is an English version of [《Go Web编程》](https://github.com/astaxie/build-web-application-with-golang), which original version was written by [AstaXie](https://github.com/astaxie) and translated by [Unknown](https://github.com/Unknwon).

This book is about how to build web applications in Go. In the first few chapters of the book, the author will review some basic knowledge about Go. However, for an optimal reading experience, you should have a basic understanding of the Go language and the concept of a web application. If you are completely new to programming, this book is not intended to provide sufficient introductory material to get started.

If anything is unclear due to wording or language issues, feel free to ask me to write a better translation.

###Purpose
Because I'm interested in web application development, I used my free time to write this book as open source version. It doesn't mean that I have a very good ability to build web applications; I would like to share what I've done with Go in building web applications.

- For those of you who are working with PHP/Python/Ruby, you will learn how to build a web application with Go.
- For those of you who are working with C/C++, you will learn how the web works.

I believe the purpose of studying is sharing with others. The happiest thing in my life is sharing everything I've known with more people.

###Donation
