#1.1 Installation
##Three ways to install Go
There are many ways to install Go development environment in your computer, you can choose any one you like. I only show you three most common ways as follows.

- Install from source code.
	- This is the most popular way of installation for people who are familiar with Unix or Unix-like systems, especially when you are a developer.
- Use standard installation packages.
	- Go team provides convenient installation packages for Windows, Linux, Mac and other operating systems. This is the easiest way for new beginners.
- Use third-party tools.
	- There are many third-party tools for installing Go, like apt-get in Ubuntu, homebrew in Mac, etc. It requires you to know how to use these tools.
	
In case you want to install more than one version of Go in one computer, you should take a look at the tool called [GVM](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm). It is the best tool I've seen so far for achieving this job, otherwise you have to know how to deal with this problem by yourself.

##Install from source code
Because some parts of Go are written in Plan 9 C and AT&T assembler, you have to install a C compiler before taking the next step.

In Mac, once you install the Xcode, you have already have the compiler.

In Unix-like systems, you need to install gcc or some other compiler. For example, you can install compiler by executing command `sudo apt-get install gcc libc6-dev` in Ubuntu.

In Windows, you need to install MinGW in order to install gcc. Don't forget to configure environment variables after finished installation.( ***Everything looks like this means it's commented by translator: If you are using 64-bit Windows, you would better install 64-bit version of MinGW*** )

The Go team uses [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/) to manage source code, so you need to install this tool in order to download Go source code.

At this point, execute following commands to clone Go source code, and start compiling.( ***It will clone source code to you current directory, switch your work path before you continue. Depends on your computer performance, it usually takes one minute, and one hour in Raspberry Pi*** )

	hg clone -u release https://code.google.com/p/go
	cd go/src
	./all.bash 
	
The installation will not be succeed until you see "ALL TESTS PASSED" on your screen.

The commands above are Unix-style. It's not very different in Windows by running the `all.bat`.

If you are using Windows, installation package will set environment variables automatically. In Unix-like systems, you need to set these variables manually as follows.( ***If your Go version is greater than 1.0, you don't have to set $GOBIN, and it will automatically be related to your $GOROOT/bin, which we will talk about in the next section***)

    export GOROOT=$HOME/go
    export GOBIN=$GOROOT/bin
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin

If you see the following information on your screen, you're all set.

Once you see the Usage information of Go, it means you successfully installed Go on your computer. If it says "no such command", you'd better check if your $PATH environment variable contains the installation path of Go.

##Use standard installation packages
Go has one-click installation packages for every operating system. These packages will install Go in /usr/local/go (c:\Go in Windows) by default. Of course you can change it, but you also need to change all the environment variables manually as I showed above.

###How to check your operating system is 32-bit or 64-bit?
Our next step depends on your operating system type, so we have to check it before we download the standard installation packages.

If you are using Windows, press `Win+R` and then run the command tool, type command `systeminfo` and it shows some useful information just few seconds. Find the line with "system type", if you see "x64-based PC" means your operating system is 64-bit, 32-bit otherwise.

I strongly recommend you download 64-bit version of package if you are Mac users because Go is no longer support pure 32-bit processors in Mac OS.

Linux users can just type `uname -a` in the terminal to see system information.
64-bit operating system shows as follows.

    <some description> x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    // some machines such as Ubuntu 10.04 will show as following
    x86_64 GNU/Linux

32-bit operating system shows as follows.

    <some description> i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

###Mac
Go to the [download page](http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list), choose `go1.0.3.darwin-386.pkg` for 32-bit systems and `go1.0.3.darwin-amd64.pkg` for 64-bit systems. All the way to the end by clicking "next", `~/go/bin` will be added to $PATH after you finished the installation. Now just open the terminal and type `go`. You should now see the what is displayed in figure 1.1.

###Linux
Go to the [download page]((http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list), choose `go1.0.3.linux-386.tar.gz` for 32-bit systems and `go1.0.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz` for 64-bit systems. Suppose you want to install Go in path `$GO_INSTALL_DIR`, uncompress `tar.gz` to the path by command `tar zxvf go1.0.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C $GO_INSTALL_DIR`. Then set your $PATH `export PATH=$PATH:$GO_INSTALL_DIR/go/bin`. Now just open the terminal and type `go`. You should now see the what is displayed in figure 1.1.

###Windows
Go to the [download page]((http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list), choose `go1.0.3.windows-386.msi` for 32-bit systems and `go1.0.3.windows-amd64.msi` for 64-bit systems. All the way to the end by clicking "next", `c:/go/bin` will be added to `path`. Now just open a command line window and type `go`. You should now see the what is displayed in figure 1.1.

##Use third-party tools
###GVM
GVM is a Go multi-version control tool developed by third-party, like rvm in ruby. It's quite easy to use it. Install gvm by typing following commands in your terminal.

    bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)

Then we install Go by following commands.

    gvm install go1.0.3
    gvm use go1.0.3

After the process finished, you're all set.
###apt-get
Ubuntu is the most popular desktop release version of Linux. It uses `apt-get` to manage packages. We can install Go using the following commands.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gophers/go
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install golang-stable

###homebrew
Homebrew is a software manage tool commonly used in Mac to manage software. Just type following commands to install Go.

    brew install go
