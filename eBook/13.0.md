# 13 How to design a Web framework
Preceding twelve chapter describes how to develop Web applications through Go, introduced a lot of basic knowledge, development tools and techniques, then we pass this knowledge in this chapter to implement a simple Web framework. Go language to achieve through a complete frame design, the main contents of this framework, the first section describes the structure of a Web framework planning, such as using the MVC pattern to develop, program execution process design, etc.; second section describes the framework the first feature: Routing, how to get access to the URL mapped to the corresponding processing logic; third section describes the processing logic, how to design a common controller, object inheritance after the handler how to handle response and request; fourth section describes how to framework some auxiliary functions, such as log processing, configuration information, etc.; fifth section describes how to implement a blog-based Web framework, including Bowen published, modify, delete, display a list of other operations.

Through such a complete project example, I expect to be able to allow readers to understand how to develop Web applications, how to build your own directory structure, how to achieve routing, how to achieve the MVC pattern and other aspects of developing content. In the framework prevalent today, MVC is no longer a myth. Many programmers often heard discussions which frame is good, which frame is not good, in fact, the framework is only a tool, there is no good or bad, only suitable or unsuitable, for his is the best, so we write their own framework for the church, then different needs can use their own ideas to be realized.
